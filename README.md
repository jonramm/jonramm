<h3>About me:</h3>
<p>
Professional trombone player turned tech-head, Jon is a budding developer with an insatiable appetite for learning. He hopes to join the vibrant tech scene in Pittsburgh, PA with aspirations in furthering his education in embedded systems and machine learning. Having used the language of music to communicate with humanity thus far, Jon is thrilled to engage in a new form of expression and discovery through modern technology and cutting-edge web development.

My big side project is a website called BookEater that allows unique users to create an account and keep track of books they've read. Users can write journal entries and decide how books 'taste' by choosing from a wide variety of illustrations depicting flavors and feelings. Implemented as a React SPA with a Node.js/Express/MySQL backend. Other projects include two hackathon entries, a Python/Flask desktop app for searching band tour dates, and a Python command line Hangman game. 

I was a successful professional musician in Portland, OR and New Orleans, LA from 2010 to 2021 but Covid-19 has caused me to shift my focus and pursue a career in computer science. I look forward to having two passions in my life!
