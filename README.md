<h3>About me:</h3>
<p>
  A professional musician for over a decade, Jon has been everywhere. From Portland, OR to New Orleans, LA, bars and clubs to SNL and The Grammys, swamps and magnolias to high desert and juniper. Though music is still his passion, he took a long, hard look at the pandemic and decided to study computer science in an effort to future-proof his life. His gaze is fixed on the intersection of art and technology, forging a path through a constantly changing world.
