<h3>About me:</h3>
<p>
  Current computer science student with an excellent aptitude for programming seeking full-time work or internship. Looking for a challenging environment to get practical experience in the field and develop my skills as a programmer in a team setting. I'm currently working primarily with Python and JavaScript.

My big side project is a website called BookEater that allows unique users to create an account and keep track of books they've read. Users can write journal entries and decide how books 'taste' by choosing from a wide variety of illustrations depicting flavors and feelings. Implemented as a React SPA with a Node.js/Express/MySQL backend. Other projects include two hackathon entries, a Python/Flask desktop app for searching band tour dates, and a Python command line Hangman game. 

I was a successful professional musician in Portland, OR and New Orleans, LA from 2010 to 2021 but Covid-19 has caused me to shift my focus and pursue a career in computer science. I look forward to having two passions in my life!
